MESA3D FOR WINDOWS -- http://mesa.fdossena.com

This library provides software rendering capabilities to OpenGL applications.
Note that software rendering is a LOT slower than 3D accelerators, so this library should only be used as a last resort, with old OpenGL games that won't run on newer hardware.


To use Mesa3D, simply extract opengl32.dll in the same directory as the application executable.
(right click the shortcut > Open File Location, this is where you should extract it)
